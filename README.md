## Hi there! I'm Shubh Agarwal 👋

I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in _Computer Science and Engineering_ at _IIT Dharwad_,
where I've honed my skills in a wide range of programming languages, tools, and 
frameworks. My academic journey, combined with hands-on projects and a prestigious
**DAAD WISE internship**, has equipped me with a deep understanding of complex systems
and innovative technologies.

## 🚀 About Me

- **🔭 I’m currently working on**:
  - Developing unikernels for 5g-NR functions and test various performance and energy parameters.
  - Modifying a quantum time synchronisation algorithm to work on low heralding.
 
- **🌱 I’m currently learning**:
  - Enhancing my problem solving skills.
  - Learning unikraft and various other unikernel build tools.

- **👯 I’m looking to collaborate on**:
  - Open-source projects that involve large-scale systems or require performance optimization.
  - Solving some real world problems in general ...

### 💻 Projects
You can browse repositories to know about the projects I am worked on. Some projects which 
are not here are mentioned below:

- **Power Measurement Pipeline in EARNEST**  
  Developed an automated pipeline using scaphandre to measure system power consumption of
  VMs and containers, with power metrics exposed to Prometheus and visualized on a custom
  Grafana dashboard. [Read the paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10427350)

- **Accelerating Low-PHY 5G Functions using FPGA**  
  Leveraged FPGA's parallel processing capabilities to reduce the processing time of 5G functions,
  resulting in a 63% reduction in processing time.
